# Uber-Drive-Order-Food
This is an Uber clone app, coded all by myself on React-native and tailwind CSS. The project uses 4 to 5 Google API's, so in order to clone this you need to have 
Google map's API access from Google Cloud. Following are the API's: 
1. Google Places API (Autocomplete places) 
2. Google Directions API (Origin Destination) 
3. Google Matrix API for milage or value, cost etc
